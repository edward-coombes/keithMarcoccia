		<h2 align="center"> Money in Politics: How To Fix a Corrupt System </h2>
		<p> In an ideal representative democracy, the will of the people prevails. Elected officials pass laws and policies based on the wants and needs of voters. The United States was founded on the principle of being for the people and by the people. Does our current congress act based on the will of the people? A study conducted by Professors Martin Gilens of Princeton University, and Benjamin Page of Northwestern University, examined the influence average citizens have on policies passed by congress. They did this by looking at public opinion surveys, and comparing them to the policies that became law. The findings of their research were extremely startling for the average American voter. They found that “The estimated impact of average citizens’ preferences drops precipitously, to a non-significant, near-zero level.” Or in other words, Congress does not care what the American people think. This research has suggested that the bottom ninety percent of all wage earners in the United States have no political influence on the actions of congress. Further findings in the study show that economic elites, and interest groups have an extremely significant effect on policy. They have gained this influence through large campaign donations in what is essentially legal bribery. Campaigns don’t accept their money directly, but do so through Political Action Committees (PACs), which are supposedly independent from the campaign. Wealthy individuals, as well as interest groups, can donate unlimited funds to PACs completely anonymously. These contributions have been termed “dark money”. Political Action Committees run advertisements for candidates, as well as negative advertisements against their opponents. In the 2014 Senatorial elections, PACs collectively spent over $500 million. In order to ensure that congress represents the people and not special interests, we need to pass a constitutional amendment that dissolves Political Action Committees, and makes it illegal for any group or institution to spend money on campaign advertisements. Campaigns must be purely funded by individual citizens with contributions inside the legal limit. We the people must fund the candidates, that way the only ones congress will owe favors to is us.  </p>
		<p> During the Presidential election of 1980, Republican candidate Ronald Reagan ran a campaign with a bold new economic plan. He believed high taxes and government regulations were dampening growth, his proposal was a series of tax cuts that were mainly concentrated on high-income individuals. The idea was that if the rich were unburdened by taxes, they would invest more money in the economy. This new source of revenue was supposed to create jobs, and lead to a newly stimulated economy. Reagan won the election and implemented his plan, which was later coined “Reaganomics”. Although the US experienced a few years of growth during the Reagan era, the national debt tripled from one to three trillion dollars over the course of his presidency. Fast forward to the modern day and many Republicans still hold on to this theory. One of them is Governor Sam Brownback of Kansas. In 2010, Brownback ran on a similar platform, cut income-taxes on the wealthiest Kansans, and economic growth and job creation will follow. Once elected, Gov. Brownback slashed taxes on the wealthy to just 3.6% of their income, while poor Kansans pay a rate of 11.6%. To make up for lost revenue, Brownback increased the sales tax. His plan failed abysmally. By the end of his first term the state announced that it had a $600 million budget deficit, if action is not taken this is expected to grow to over a billion dollars. The poor and middle class in Kansas suffered greatly, as cuts were made to education, welfare, and infrastructure. Reaganomics created a nightmare for the people of Kansas, and yet many Republicans refuse to acknowledge its failures. They do this because wealthy donors, and corporations who benefit from it, are bankrolling their campaigns; Gov. Brownback has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporations over the course of his career. The citizens of Kansas need officials that represent them and their needs, however they won’t get this while the wealthy can buy elections.  </p>
		<p> Sometimes corruption and bribery can lead to more than just economic hardships. In 2013 over 33,000 people died as a result of gun violence; which is only slightly below deaths relating to car accidents. Gun control is an extremely controversial and partisan issue in US politics, however there are some areas where Americans on both sides of the spectrum agree. Currently, eighty-five percent of all Americans support expanding background checks on gun sales. Seventy-nine percent of Americans also support bans on the mentally ill from buying firearms. Despite this overwhelming support from the public, congress still has not passed any significant gun reform. This may be due to the National Rifle Association (NRA), an interest group that is opposed to all forms of gun control. In the 2014 election cycle, the NRA spent nearly $1 million directly on campaign contributions. They also spent over $3 million on lobbying, and a whopping $28 million on outside spending, which includes all political advertisements paid for by the NRA. So long as they have this much power and influence over members of congress, effective gun control will not be passed. Thousands of people continue to die from gun violence while the NRA continues to lobby and bribe our government officials.  </p>
		<p> A dramatic increase in outside spending has occurred recently because of the Supreme Court case known as “Citizens United”. The Supreme court ruled that political spending is a form of protected speech, and that the government cannot stop corporations or unions from spending money in support of a candidate. Research done by the Brennan Center for Justice Analysis, found that since Citizens United was decided in 2010, super PACs have spent over $1 billion on influencing elections. Around 60% of that was given by just 195 wealthy individuals and their spouses. Dark money, or money given to PACS anonymously, has more than doubled in Senate races, amounting to $226 million in 2014. With Citizens United, the Supreme Court paved the way for corruption, and made bribery legal in the United States. If we are to have fair and representative elections, the Citizens United decision must be overturned, as well as a constitutional Amendment to eliminate big money from politics once and for all.  </p>
		<p> To pass an amendment to the Constitution is not easy. In the traditional method, a two-thirds majority is needed in both the house and the senate, as well as affirmation from three-fourths of the states. Congress would never pass an amendment to reform campaign, as they are the ones who benefit from the current system. However there is another method which has never been used, a Constitutional convention. Article V of the Constitution describes how this is can be carried out, “...the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution…” If 34 states call for it, a Constitutional Convention must be held. Harvard Professor, and former 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate, Lawrence Lessig was one of the first to propose a convention. He believes that Congress will not change unless they are pressured from the outside. In his words “A convention is the chance for such pressure. It is also the chance for America to focus on solutions...That is the convention’s role: to provide an alternative to Washington as the place where our nation’s constitutional problems can be addressed and possibly solved.” By calling for a convention, we can bypass Congress completely, pass our own amendment to the Constitution, and reform campaign finance.  </p>
		<p> The American people are ready for a drastic change to our political system. This is evident in the current Presidential election cycle. Two candidates, one in each major political party, have spoken out against the epidemic of corruption. Donald Trump, the current front runner in the Republican primary, shocked the audience during a Fox News Presidential debate. Trump said “…the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage. But they have total control of the politicians. They’re making a fortune.” On the democratic side, Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has made fighting corruption one of his major platforms. He has described corruption as a threat to our democracy, and called for campaign finance reform, "A few wealthy individuals and corporations have bought up our private sector and now they're buying up the government. Campaign finance reform is the most important issue facing us today, because it impacts all the others." Both Trump and Sanders have a huge base of supporters, which shows that many Americans are ready to go outside the political establishment to enact real change. American citizens must stand together and demand that their state legislatures call for a Constitutional Convention, and pass an Amendment that stops corporations and interest groups from buying elections. Political Action Committees must be dissolved, and outside groups must not be allowed to advertise for or against campaigns. The wealthy have stolen our Democracy, and it’s time we took it back.	</p>
