<h2 align="center">America’s Crumbling Transportation Infrastructure </h2>
<p>Traditionally, transportation infrastructure in the US has been funded by taxation and grants from states or the national government. At their recent levels, these streams of revenue have been unable to effectively cover the rising costs of maintaining and expanding roads and bridges. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), there is a gap of almost $850 billion between the funds needed to improve roads and bridges and the funds that local, state, and the federal government has allocated (ASCE, 2013). As a result, the quality of transportation infrastructure in the US has declined over the past few decades. In 2017, the ASCE analyzed infrastructure in the US and gave it a D+ rating. This rating means our public infrastructure is considered “poor” and “at risk” (Zanona, 2017). Recent governmental studies add weight to this assessment. A survey released by the Federal Highway Administration states that nearly 20% of roads in the country are in poor condition (US Department of Transportation, 2015). In 2002 the Congressional Budgeting Office (CBO) reported that even just maintaining transportation systems at their current levels requires an additional $20 billion annually (Congressional Budgeting Office 2002). </p>
<p>Poor road and bridge infrastructure is a problem that negatively affects the daily lives of millions of Americans. Neglect of our nation's roads and highways have created treacherous commutes for the working class, as motorists are faced with damaging potholes. Road capacity has not been able to keep up with increasing amounts of vehicles on the road so congestion has become a major issue. A study on transportation in America found that traffic delays in urban areas have doubled over the past three decades (Winston, 2013). This past June, CNN published a piece on our infrastructure problems and who it impacts. A motorist in Michigan told reporters that terrible road conditions have caused significant damage to her vehicle, including a blown out tire. Many potholes exists on busy highways on her way to work, so it is nearly impossible to swerve and avoid them (Simon and Clarke, 2019).  </p>
<p> It is undoubtedly the responsibility of the government to address problems with the nation’s roads and bridges. Ensuring adequate transportation is a public service that the government provides using taxes from the American people. It makes sense that they should also work to improve this service when it falters. Investing in our infrastructure is also a smart policy position because it will create significant economic benefits. Political scientist Elizabeth McNichol writes “The condition of roads, bridges, schools, water treatment plants, and other physical assets greatly influences the economy’s ability to function and grow. Commerce requires well-maintained roads, railroads, airports, and ports so that manufacturers can obtain raw materials and parts, and deliver finished products to consumers.” (McNichol, 2016). While improving infrastructure in the US is a costly endeavor, the projected economic gains will offset those costs. In order to address the issue of underfunding for transportation infrastructure, public officials across the country have been exploring a number of different policy options. </p>
<p> Policy-makers could potentially go down the route of privatization to deal with the funding gap for transportation infrastructure. Several long-term concession agreements, also known as public-private partnerships (PPP), have recently been reached between state and local governments and private entities. This involves temporarily giving control of toll roads and bridges to investors in return for significant amounts of money. In 2014, the city of Chicago leased a toll bridge to private investors in exchange for nearly $2 billion. This gave significant revenue to invest in transportation infrastructure and public education. This inspired the state of Indiana to pursue a similar solution. They leased their toll road to foreign investors for nearly $4 billion which allowed them to fully fund a long term transportation plan (Ortiz and Buxbaum, 2008). Conservative politicians, interest groups, and citizens are likely to support these policies. This is due to the fact that it does not involve raising taxes and limits the size of government. </p>
<p> Several advantages of long-term concession agreements to the public sector have been identified. First, public officials have flexibility in how they can use the proceeds from these deals. Funds can be used to address any public issue, such as funding transportation projects like the state of Indiana did. This differs from grants and bonds which have strict limitations in how their proceeds can be used (Brown, 2007). Second, PPPs involve contracts that allow the public sector to impose operating and maintenance standards. For example, Texas engaged in a PPP to expand its State Highway. Not only did the state receive over $2 billion upfront, the terms of agreement required the investor spend $1.7 billion for maintenance (Brown, 2007).  If the private investor violates these conditions then control of the assets will go back to the public sector. </p>
<p> Some decision-makers have raised concerns regarding long-term concession agreements. The heads of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of the U.S. House of Representatives released a statement warning against PPPs regarding highways because “many such arrangements do not protect the public interest” (Oberstar & DeFazio, 2007). Private-sector interests may conflict with public-sector interests. The ultimate goal of the private sector when entering these deals is to maximize toll revenue. If tolls are set too high, it may cause a diversion away from the tolled highway toward public ones which might result in increased congestion. Labor issues are also associated with concession deals. Toll employees under the public sector enjoy job security, set wages and benefits. There is a concern that private investors will be exempt from some labor regulations, which jeopardizes employee benefits. Jobs may also be lost due to greater efficiencies in the private sector (Ortiz and Buxbaum, 2008). </p>
<p> Public officials may be wary of privatizing transportation infrastructure and prefer to raise additional funds in the public sector. One method to do this called value capture,where the value of private land owing is captured through land-related taxes or other fees. One of the most commonly used strategies for value capturing is tax increment financing (TIF). Public improvements like highway access and improved road quality tend to increase property values, and as a result also increases taxes. TIF uses future tax revenue in advance to fund the transportation development. TIF is a favored strategy for local governments; it is used across 49 states and in the District of Columbia (Briffault 2010). In 1985, Evanston, Illinois used TIF funding to revitalize a run-down section of their city. The revenue gained allowed them to “pay for infrastructure improvements, attract private investment, and eliminate blight” (Capron et. al, 2012). This strategy is more agreeable to those who consider themselves more liberal than conservative. Left-leaning individuals tend to prefer government spending to improve services over privatization. TIF also increases equity because allows investments in poorer areas, such as inner cities (Zhao et. al , 2010). </p>
<p> This method is advantageous because it allows the government to develop transportation infrastructure in areas that it normally wouldn’t be able to. TIF funds can be tailored to fit the needs of a certain area. It is also considered a self-financing method because is uses revenue generated by a project to fund the project itself. This means that public officials do not need to pass a new tax to gain revenue for infrastructure. They can either increase existing property taxes or borrow against the expected gains in tax revenue. There are also some drawbacks to tax increment financing. It relies on increases in property values, which is influenced by several other factors such as the regional economy and the real estate market (Zhao et. al, 2010). Another concern for the public is that TIF can lead to displacement of residents or local businesses who cannot afford the increased property taxes. Evaluations of the effectiveness of TIF projects have bred mixed results. Generally, they have led to property value growth within the district but there are exceptions. An examination of TIF districts in Texas found that one in five experienced no economic growth following the completion of their projects (Briffault, 2010). </p>
<p> Of the two financing methods previously examined, tax increment financing appears to be a more reliable way to gain revenue than public-private partnerships. Examinations of the latter have found that many do not produce the expected benefits. In their analysis of PPPs, policy analysts Garvin and Bosso explains that “The cases studied, indicated structural imbalances and/or high levels of tension, which resulted in generally high transaction costs and poor outcomes” (Garvin and Bosso, 2008). TIF projects on the other hand, generally succeed in creating a solid revenue base. Property values and retail sales usually increase in TIF districts (Briffault, 2010). It is important to note that results vary throughout different areas of the country. A study conducted by Illinois economists found that cities who adopt TIF grow more slowly than those who do not (Dye and Merriman, 1999). This differs with a study of Indiana TIFs, which concluded that they are an effective way to stimulate local economies (Man, 1999). </p>
<p> Tax-increment financing also keeps transportation infrastructure in the hands of the public sector. This means decision-makers would avoid many of the concerns the public has with privatization. With long-term concession agreements, private entities seek to yield greater returns to make their investment worthwhile. This turns toll roads into an instrument to maximize profit for private firms rather than a tool to raise money for the public good. Since roads and bridges are generally viewed as public enterprises, the public is inclined to reject the idea of someone profiting off of them (Ortiz and Buxbaum, 2008). Public officials could limit excessive profits through stipulations in PPP contracts, but this would reduce the value of the agreement, leading to lower payments from the private entity. </p>
<p> It would be nearly impossible to implement tax-increment financing at the national level, so advocates of this policy position would have to work with state and local governments. Potential allies which could assist in building public support for TIF would be left-leaning economic justice groups. As previously mentioned, TIFs can be used to improve infrastructure in neglected areas, such as inner cities. These areas tend to be populated by poor and minority populations, which economic justice groups are known to fight for. Opposition for TIF would most likely come from right-leaning groups. Their strategy would be to outline the increases in taxes to influence public opinion against TIF projects. Public officials could combat this strategy by hosting town hall meetings where they can allay these concerns by outlining the economic benefits TIF brings to communities. Another alternative would be for public officials to borrow against projected property tax increases instead of preemptively raising taxes to fund TIF projects. </p>
