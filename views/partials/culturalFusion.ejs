<h2 align="center">Cultural Fusion in the Danelaw </h2>
<h3 align="left">Introduction </h3>
<p>The Viking Era in England began in the late 7th century, when a series of abbeys and churches were plundered by Scandinavian sailors. At first these raids were carried out by isolated warbands who were only interested in taking what they could and leaving. This changed in 865 when a significant force of Norsemen united under two leaders, Halfdane and Ivar the Boneless, landed in East Anglia. They captured York, the capital of Northumbria, and colonized large swaths of land in Northern and Eastern England. For almost a century, the Scandinavians occupied this territory and implemented Danish law practices. As a result, this area became known as the Danelaw. </p>
<p>When two different cultural groups are brought under one political entity, either one culture is assimilated into the other or a hybrid culture is created. In the case of the Danelaw, historians generally agree that a hybrid culture was formed between the native English and their Scandinavian colonizers. This paper seeks to determine the extent of this hybridization by analyzing several aspects of society in the Danelaw, such as religion, material culture, language, and currency. While Viking presence in England was relatively short in the scope of its history, Scandinavian influence on the English identity is far more long-lasting. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Pagan and Christian Integration </h3>
<p> During the early years of Viking occupation in the Danelaw, the English and the Scandinavians held significantly different religious beliefs. The English, who subscribed to Christianity, often referred to the Scandinavians as pagans due to their pantheon of several deities. Eventually the Viking settlers began converting to Christianity. Whether this was a rapid assimilation of Christian beliefs or a slow transition away from paganism is unclear. Ecclesiastical records during this time were poorly kept both in and out of the Danelaw. Abrams writes “The armies arrived in England as pagans; they settled and became Christian; but only tantalisingly ambiguous physical evidence and scraps of written material survive to help answer the questions when and how.” There are recorded instances of some Scandinavian leaders accepting baptism. After his defeat by King Alfred in 878, Guthrum and thirty of his soldiers were baptized. It is possible that this instance of conversion and many others were performed for political reasons. Viking leaders would have undoubtedly benefited from ecclesiastical support and the appearance of Christianization may have helped to promote stability in the Danelaw. Evidence of a partnership between the church and the Vikings comes in the form of currency. Scandinavian minters in York produced coins which carried the name of St. Peter. In fact, some coins from the time period discovered in York had both pagan and Christian imagery printed on them. This suggests that Scandinavians accepted some aspects of Christianity while still maintaining their native beliefs. </p>
<p> The view that Vikings in the Danelaw slowly mixed Christian and pagan traditions is supported by archeological findings of burial sites from the time period. Uncovered graves, mounds, and shrines reveal a host of different burial practices that cannot simply be classified as pagan or Christian. In the Isle of Man, an island between Ireland and England, Vikings desecrated a Christian graveyard and replaced it with a pagan burial mound. Nearby at Peel Castle, a Scandinavian woman known as the “Pagan-Lady” was interred in a Christian style stone grave. In her essay on burial practices in the Danelaw, Richards examines graves excavated in Repton. It is the area where the Great Viking Army wintered after driving out the Mercian King. She notes that the mausoleum of St. Wystan remained undesecrated and that pagan burial mounds were erected alongside it. Although this was early in the Viking occupation, before their conversion to Christianity, it shows the willingness of Scandinavians to accommodate the native populace. By the 10th century, local Danish aristocrats were being buried at the St. Wystan shrine in a Christianized fashion. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Scandinavian Influence on Christianity </h3>
<p> While the scope and speed of the Scandinavian conversion to Christianity is unclear, the Viking occupation of the Danelaw had a profound impact on Catholicism in England. When Ivar the Boneless landed his army in East Anglia, he sent a message to King Edmund demanding that he surrender his wealth and become a vassal to the Vikings. In his account on the life of King Edmund, Abbo of Fleury writes that his bishop encouraged the King to give in to Ivar’s demands as he did not have the military strength to oppose him. Edmund refused to give in to the demands of a pagan and replied that he would only submit to Ivar if he became a Christian. Abbo then describes how the Vikings killed King Edmund by beheading him and what followed after. The local people buried him in haste and years later they moved his body to a church they built in his honor. When they dug up his body, they discovered that it had been completely healed and his head had been reattached in a miracle by God. For the English, King Edmunds defiance towards the Viking pagans symbolized piety and love for Christ. The story of King Edmund’s martyrdom became so profound among the English that he achieved sainthood and became the first patron saint of England. This important figure in Catholicism is a lasting reminder of the legacy of the Vikings in the Danelaw. </p>
<p> Not only did the Viking occupation of the Danelaw contribute to Catholic lore, it also had a significant influence on ecclesiastical art. By the time the Great Army landed on the shores of East Anglia, the Vikings had already built a legacy of sculpting and engraving in wood and stone. They carried this tradition with them to the Danelaw. England experienced an explosion in quantity of stone monuments during the Scandinavian colonial period. Many monuments of Christian origin were refashioned to include images of Nordic iconography. An important example of this is the Nunburnholme cross in York. It was a block of limestone where the Anglo-Saxons had carved an image of a crucifix. After their conquest of Northumbria, Viking sculptors carved new images on the cross. One side depicts a man sitting on a throne armed with a sword common to the warriors of the Great Army. The Nunburnholme cross is an example of the Vikings incorporating their own culture into existing ecclesiastical culture. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Assimilation Through Material Culture </h3>
<p> In the absence of detailed historical records, it is necessary to examine excavated artifacts to get a glimpse of life in the Danelaw. Material culture is a good indicator of societal norms and expressions of identity. A significant amount of Scandinavian metal work has recently been discovered by metal detecting in northeastern England. It has yielded brooches belonging to female dresses which were worn by colonial women in the Danelaw during the ninth and tenth centuries. Some of these artifacts are distinctly Scandinavian and were either brought over imported from the homeland. Other brooches were produced domestically and are a mix of Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian styles. Disc brooches, commonly worn by Anglo-Saxon women, were decorated with Scandinavian animal ornaments. These types of artifacts were found in places all over the Danelaw, including York and East Anglia. A high concentration of these Anglo-Scandinavian brooches were discovered in Norfolk which suggests that they were manufactured there. </p>
<p> In addition to brooches, other dress accessories have been excavated such as pendants and strap-ends. Pendants discovered from the Danelaw have designs printed on them which are identical to those found on disc brooches This suggests that Scandinavian pendant motifs were transferred to brooches in the Danelaw. Kershaw notes that because pendants were not worn by Anglo-Saxons during this time, that process provides evidence of cultural accommodation, where Scandinavian styles were adapted to match local preferences. A strap-end found in York has a Borre style ring-knot decoration on one side and an Anglo-Saxon style ring and dot on the other side. </p>
<p> From these examples, it is clear that material culture was an important tool for cultural fusion in the Danelaw. Disc-brooches were used to display Scandinavian imagery because they were familiar to both peoples which made integration easier. Dress accessories may have been an outlet for colonial Scandinavian women to express their native culture while still adhering to local styles. In this sense, women were the bearers of a new colonial identity within the Danelaw which was a hybrid between Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian cultures. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Language Contact: Old Norse and Old English </h3>
<p> The two hundred year presence of Vikings in England meant that there was considerable language contact between the Scandinavian language of Old Norse (ON) and the Anglo-Saxon language of Old English (OE). These interactions led to significant impacts on the English language, especially when it comes to dialects in northern and eastern England. Many modern English words such as, steak, snare, sprint, and flat, have a Norse origin. Some words from Old Norse completely replaced words from Old English. For example, the word window comes from the ON word vindauga which translates to “wind eye”. This replaced the OE word eyethurl or “eye hole”. Old Norse was spoken throughout the Danelaw but it was often lost as areas were re-claimed by the English, sometimes in as little as two generations. In other areas, a language variety, or “koine”, emerged which contained aspects of ON and OE. The koine was adopted within three generations by inhabitants after they were reintegrated under English control . The term “koine” is a situation of language contact where features of each language are mixed by reduction or simplification. Therefore “koineization” occurs gradually after long contact between speakers of two languages who can understand each other to some extent. Evidence of a koineization between ON and OE is shown in English words that were modified by taking on a Scandinavian element. One such word is Thursday which is a simplification of the OE word Thunresdœg. Koineization was easy between Old Norse and Old English because they were structurally close enough that both kinds of speakers could understand each other without learning the other language. </p>
<p> Another aspect of linguistic fusion between Old Norse and Old English are personal names given to inhabitants of the Danelaw, as well as names given to places. Three types of processes led to the formation of names during this time period. The first is Scandinavianization of Old English names. Scandinavians who spoke Old Norse accepted Old English names into their repertoire but adapted them for easier pronunciation. One of the earliest examples of this is the name Jádulfr, which is a Scandinavianized version of the Anglo-Saxon word for Lincolnshire. The second process of name formation in the Danelaw is the Anglicization of Old Norse names. An example of this is the transformation of the name Geirsteinn to Garstin. This changes the ON syllables of geir and steinn to the OE syllables of gar and stin. Simpson notes that Anglicanized names like this were more common in northern areas of the Danelaw such as Norfolk, while Scandinavianized names were more common in southern areas. This fact suggests that cultural hybridization was not uniform throughout the Danelaw. Anglo-Saxon culture may have had a stronger influence over Scandinavian culture in some areas while other areas may have experienced the opposite effect. The third category of names offers substantial proof of a hybrid culture emerging in the Danelaw. These names were not Scandinavian names with Anglican elements nor the inverse, they are entirely new names created with both Old Norse and Old English elements. The emergence of these names occurred surprisingly early in the history of Viking settlement in the Danelaw.  Hybrid names such as Bretakollr, Þurwine, and Þurweard originate from the early eleventh century. This suggests that hybrid naming traditions were adopted quickly in some parts of the Danelaw. Simpson points out that this phenomenon was unique to the Danelaw. No other Scandinavian colony experienced name hybridization. </p>
<p> Examining language contact between the Scandinavian colonizers and the native Anglo-Saxons does not support the view that their cultures existed in isolation from each other in the Danelaw or that one culture was assimilated into the other.  The fact that the modern English language contains words with Nordic origins shows that Old Norse was never fully erased from English linguistics. This point is also supported by evidence which shows that Old Norse and Old English underwent an koineization where ON and OE words were melded over time. Name hybridization with elements of both languages also means that neither culture fully assimilated into the other. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Conclusion </h3>
<p> When Ivar the Boneless and the Great Army of Vikings first landed on the shores of East Anglia, their culture was distinctly different from the native Anglo-Saxons. During the two centuries that the Danelaw was occupied and colonized by the Vikings, Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon society experienced prolonged contact and this led to the gradual formation of a hybrid culture. Ecclesiastical records, as limited as they were from the time period, show that the vikings eventually converted to Christianity, however it is evident that Norse mythology was never truly lost in the Danelaw. Integration between pagan and Christian beliefs is evident in archeological findings of burial sites in northern and eastern England. It reveals that many people during this time period were buried with a mix of pagan and Christian traditions. Viking culture also rubbed off on Christian art. The Nunburnholme cross near York is a monument which displays Christ’s crucifiction with Scandinavian imagery carved into it. </p>
<p> Cultural fusion between the Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons is also supported by metalwork discovered in the Danelaw. Dress accessories, such as brooches, pendants, and strap-ends, combined both Scandinavian and indigenous fashion styles. From these findings, it may have been the case that women were the primary bearers of a new colonial identity in the Danelaw. Prolonged language contact between Old Norse and Old English led to new language varieties being formed and it has been shown that many words in the modern English language have Norse roots. Name hybridization also took place in the Danelaw which is unique as no other Scandinavian colony experienced this phenomenon. </p>
<p> All of these examples show that neither Scandinavian culture or Anglo-Saxon culture was completely assimilated into the other. A new colonial identity emerged in the Danelaw during the Viking occupation which had a profound impact on religion, material culture, and language. This hybridization was so potent that aspects of it survive to this day. </p>
