<h2 align="center">Liberalism and the US-China Trade Conflict </h2>
<p>After launching an investigation into trade policies with China in 2017, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on Chinese goods worth several billion dollars. This was the first move in a trade conflict that has been escalating for over a year. The Jinping administration retaliated by imposing its own $3 billion tariff on American made goods (Schoen and Pramuk, 2019). So far, the US has imposed $250 billion worth of duties on Chinese imports and China has imposed tariffs of $110 billion on American goods (“US-China Trade War”). There was optimism that this conflict would be resolved when China and the US agreed to cease new tariffs to allow for trade talks to take place. President Trump cast a shadow over hope for a resolution when he recently threatened to raise tariffs significantly in the near future (“Trump threatens to raise tariffs”). On Twitter he complained that "The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!" (@realDonaldTrump). If the Trump Administration goes through with their threat it is likely that China will retaliate and current negotiations will ultimately fail. </p>
<p>A trade war between China and the United States has the potential to do serious damage to the global economy in general but it’s impact on the prosperity of other East Asian nations is unclear. Some economists contend that high tariffs on exports to China will result in the US diverting some of its goods toward other East Asian countries, giving them significant trade gains. Proponents of liberalism would argue that every nation benefits from economic interdependence. Any disruption of free trade would hurt the world economy and anyone who participates in it, including East Asia. Another important aspect to consider is how the conflict between China and the US would affect diplomatic relations in East Asia. Trade wars have the potential to evolve into other conflicts which could escalate tensions between China and US allies in the region. This paper seeks to determine the impacts of the US-China trade war on the global economy, as well as the regional economy and international relations of East Asia. These effects will then be considered using liberalism as an analytical framework. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Liberalism and Trade Conflicts </h3>
<p> Liberalism is a political theory that is based on John Locke’s argument that it is the moral duty of every government to ensure life, liberty, and property for all of its citizens. For liberalists, the wellbeing of the individual is the building block of any political system. This theory is relevant to international politics because a state’s foreign policy can have a strong effect on domestic liberty. A liberal government would adopt policies that discourages conflict with other nation states, as war is a threat to individual freedom and prosperity. When it comes to economics, liberalism values cooperation and economic interdependence between states (Meiser, 2018). This means that free-trade and open markets are essential aspects of a liberal world order. </p>
<p> According to liberal theory, global trade makes each participating country better off. When countries break off their trade relationships they decrease their long-term economic well being. As a result, the other trading partners of that nation also suffer because the value of their trade is diminished. Therefore, reducing trade is costly in both domestic and global spheres (Change, Polacheck, and Robst, 1999). Under this model, the United States and China should not risk reducing trade with each other by engaging in protectionist policies, such as high tariffs. Doing so would limit the gains they receive from trade overall. </p>
<h3 align="left">Economic Consequences of the Sino-American Trade Conflict </h3>
<p> Today, China is the United States’ largest trading partner. China is the number one source of imports to the US and its third largest recipient of exports. In 2018, the value of good exports and imports combined between the two nations reached $659.8 billion (Office of the US trade Representative). If the current conflict escalates into a trade war between the US and China it would have disastrous effects on the economies of both countries and the global economy. Economic relations between China and the US was the focus of a recent report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). They examined a scenario where the trade conflict escalates and both sides increase their tariffs. Sanctions against China could result in a $100 billion loss in their trade surplus and slow their GDP growth by 0.8%. In the US, a trade war could have the potential to increase inflation, lower stock and property values, and undermine confidence in US economic policy (Jiming and Yangmei, 2019). The PIIE also remarked that since the US and China make up 40% of the world’s economy, a trade war has the potential to launch a global economic recession. </p>
<p> Another study also measured the potential impact of tariff increases proposed by the Trump administration. When other effects of trade, such as capital deepening and technological spillover, are taken into account, US GDP declines by 1.6% and Chinese GDP declines by 2.5% (Tsutsumi, 2018). Potential losses in the global economy are similarly alarming. The current conflict between the US and China could spark the eruption of a global trade war. Other countries may adopt protectionist policies of their own to protect their economic interests. If this occurred and a generalised 10% increase in import tariffs were imposed worldwide, it would lower global GDP by 3% over two years (Berthou et. al, 2018). </p>
<p> These predictions and findings support the economic tenets of classical liberalism. Liberal thinkers believe that protectionist policies like tariffs and sanctions degrade the overall gains of trade because it limits the openness of markets. The predicted decline in the GDP of China and the United States, should they continue to engage in their trade war, lends weight to this principle. Another principle of liberalism, economic interdependence between nation states, is also supported by the potential global recession that could arise if the trade war escalates. The PIIE economists identified the best-case scenario of this conflict moving forward: the US and China withdraw all tariffs introduced in 2018 and increase investments with each other (Jiming and Yangmei, 2019). Under this scenario, both countries would be adhering to liberal policies which would foster greater economic prosperity. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Implications for East Asian Economies </h3>
<p> While the US-China trade war will significantly impact the world economy in general, East Asian countries are the most exposed to this dispute. This is due to the fact that region has become increasingly economically interdependent since 2004 (Drysdale, 2012). A major proponent of this interdependence has been China. In recent years, China has made significant investments in the infrastructure of several Southeast Asian countries such as Malasia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Brunei (Ganesan, 2018). Regional trade has also increased dramatically since ASEAN signed a free trade agreement with China in 2004, which reduced or eliminated tariffs on good imports (“ASEAN-China Free Trade Area”). </p>
<p> As the trade war with the US will most likely harm China’s economy, one might conclude that its neighbors will also be negatively affected. However many economists have speculated that detrimental effects to East Asian economies will be minimal and a Sino-American trade war might even represent positive opportunities for these countries. High tariffs on Chinese goods would result in a reduction of imports from China and the US would need to replace them with suppliers from other countries. East Asian countries, such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Cambodia, offer the best replacement potential because their export structures are similar to China’s. For example, there are several goods that both Vietnam and China export to the US. These include travel bags, chairs, shrimp, and prawn (Cali, 2018). The predicted drop in Chinese exports could be supplemented by more imports from Vietnam. Similar situations of potential trade diversions also apply to Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. </p>
<p> Other byproducts of the Sino-American trade war could negatively impact East Asian economies. Tariffs on Chinese goods will lead to higher prices which will in turn lower consumption. Many Chinese goods are produced using components imported from other Southeast Asian countries, which means that they will also suffer from diminished demand (Moeller, 2018). Lower consumption also reduces global trade flows. This dampens prices of commodities which affects export-oriented economies like Indonesia, who export coal and crude petroleum to China (Zandi et. al, 2018). </p>
<p> Both the positive and negative consequences the trade war is predicted to have on the prosperity of East Asia can be explained by liberalism. Liberals would argue that the economic opportunities presented to East Asian countries by the trade war is only possible because of the openness of their markets. The ASEAN-China Free Trade Area agreement provides evidence for this position. It fostered greater economic cooperation among Southeast Asian states by reducing trade barriers. This will allow ASEAN to pick up the slack from diminished US-Chinese trade. Economic interdependence is shown by the example of East Asian exports to China suffering from reduced trade with the US. Predicted losses in global trade flows as a result of the trade war will most likely hurt the economies of Asia, which shows that tariffs dampen gains countries receive from commerce. Economic liberalization provides opportunities to those who embrace it and those who try to restrict it miss out on potential revenue. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Increased Tensions in a Volatile Region </h3>
<p> A major contribution liberalism has made to field of international relations is the Trade-Conflict model. It contends that trade can enhance cooperation between states which makes conflict less likely to occur. Since states receive significant gains from trade, they are incentivised to maintain peaceful relations with their trading partners. War would cancel the benefits of trade, therefore it is detrimental to the state. According to this principle, the Sino-American trade war has dangerous implications for diplomatic relations between China and the US. High tariffs imposed between countries usually lead to reductions in trade because it creates higher prices which in turn lowers demand (Moeller, 2018). If trade is diminished between China and the US because of tariffs, then there is less incentive for them to remain at peace with each other. Another concept in IR theory is the Thucydides trap. This notion contends that rivalries between established and rising powers often leads to war. It is based off of an observation by Greek Historian Thucydides that the Peloponnesian War was caused by “the growth of Athenian power and the fear that this caused in Sparta” (Rachman, 2018). Today, it is generally accepted that the United States is the global hegemon but China has the potential to surpass the US if it continues its current rates of economic growth. As 12 out of 16 cases of hegemonic rivalry have ended in conflict, political scientists are anxious about the future of Sino-American relations. </p>
<p> Conflict between China and the United States will undoubtedly spread to the rest of East Asia. Both countries have strong diplomatic and economic ties to several countries in the region. Recent research suggests that Southeast Asian states have adopted a hedging strategy when it comes to diplomacy with China and the US. For example, although Indonesia and Malaysia have disputes with China over territory in the South China Sea, they have both adopted foreign policies that emphasize neutrality. Indonesia has not overtly supported US military presence in East Asia while Malaysia maintains strong economic ties with China and military cooperation with the US (Han, 2018). This strategy will become increasingly difficult as conflict between China and the US continues to escalate. </p>
<p> It has been speculated that the Sino-American trade war will cause a split between the nations that make up ASEAN. One of the main rationale of ASEANS existence is to unite for global economic relevance (Pereira, 2018). If the US and China fall out, some of its members will be forced to choose sides based on external affiliations. This will threaten ASEAN’s economic coherence, which could cause it to break up. Diplomatic friction as a result of the trade war has already begun. This was made clear during the most recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. APEC is an intergovernmental forum whose members include China, the US, and several East Asian nations. For the first time in its 25 year history, the summit leaders could not agree on a formal joint statement (Lendon, 2018). Evidently disagreements on trade stood in the way of a consensus. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Conclusion </h3>
<p> Despite the recent escalations of the Sino-American trade war, conflict between both sides is not inevitable. The actions of both states moving forward will determine if relations return to normal or they continue to decline, at a great cost to global economic health. Economists predict significant detrimental effects on the GDP of both China and the US if the trade war continues to escalate. The global economy will also suffer, as tariffs lead to high prices for consumers and reductions in trade flows. Because the US and China make up a significant portion of the global economy, their trade war has the potential to create a worldwide recession. These predictions support the tenets of liberalism. Trade makes every nation better off so any state that restricts commerce misses out on potential gains. To avoid these consequences, China and the US must reach an agreement to reduce trade barriers. China should make efforts to further liberalise their markets and the US should avoid engaging in protectionist policies. </p>
<p> Putting and end to the Sino-American trade war would also avoid a potential split between the nations of ASEAN. The multinational partnership might break up based on their external economic and diplomatic ties to either country. The Trade-Conflict model of liberalism tells us that trade fosters greater cooperation between states. If China and the US put their differences aside and increase commerce with each other, then the chances of a conflict breaking out between them is reduced. </p>
