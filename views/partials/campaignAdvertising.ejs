<h2 align="center">Campaign Advertising and Public Opinion </h2>
<h3 align="left">Introduction </h3>
<p>Every election cycle voters are bombarded with advertising for political campaigns. They are present in every source of media including TV, radio, newspapers, and online sources, such as social media and video streaming sites. A significant amount of resources are used for advertising during every election. In 2016, spending on political ads in the US reached a record high of $9.8 billion (Stewart 2017). Given the prevalence of advertising in our political system, it is important to analyze their effect on the voting population. Their intended purpose is to influence voter choice but research suggests that they have effects on other aspects of the political process as well, such as voter turnout and levels of voter sophistication. In order to conceptualize the overall influence of advertising on the American voter one must analyze all of its byproducts. While there is a significant amount of literature on isolated effects of campaign advertising, very little work has been done to bring them all together. </p>
<p> Campaign advertising comes in two forms: positive ads, which seek to outline the positive qualities of a candidate, and negative ads, which seek to portray the opposing candidate in a pessimistic way. The debate is out on which form of advertising is more pervasive on the voting population. Some scholars of public opinion argue that negative ads depreciate voter turnout and perceptions of the political process. Others report the opposite effect, that negative advertising is a motivating tool that drives voters to the polls. The hope for researchers reaching a consensus on this issue is unlikely but there is still value in analyzing the debate to test the validity of both side’s claims. </p>
<p> This research paper seeks to achieve two objectives. The first is to analyze the literature on political advertising to identify its effects on various aspects of the political process and the degree to which they do so. The second is to join the debate on whether or not negative advertising is beneficial to campaigns. </p>
<h3 align="left">Impacts on the American Voter </h3>
<p> Campaigns produce advertisements with one specific goal in mind; to persuade voters to vote for their candidate. While researchers disagree on the level of impact that campaign ads have on voter choice, virtually all agree that there is a persuasive effect. In the 2004 Senate races, higher exposure to Democratic ads led to more support for the Democratic candidate and the same link was found between exposure to Republican ads and support for Republican candidates (Franz & Ridout, 2007). Vote choice in presidential campaigns is also influenced by advertising. Despite the fact that more emphasis was put on face-to-face campaigning in the 2008 presidential elections, 30-second tv ads were still found to be an effective way to obtain more votes. Analysis of that election also revealed that advertising was more impactful in non-battleground states. This was attributed to the fact that voters in those states are subjected to a much higher volume of advertising from both candidates, so their effect was somewhat mitigated (Franz & Ridout, 2010). Another interesting finding from that election showed that message consistency in advertising lead to better results. The Obama campaign produced most of their ads directly while the McCain campaign relied of a number of different sources. This allowed the Obama campaign to have more control over the themes of the messages contained in their ads, thus making them more effective (Franz & Ridout, 2010). </p>
<p> Some researchers have identified factors which can account for the degree to which advertisements influence vote choice. Political knowledge was found to be a moderating factor on the influence of advertising, those with lower levels of information were more significantly influenced (Franz & Ridout, 2007). If voters already have a good understanding of a candidate, ads have little effect on their voting behavior (Granato & Wong, 2004). This suggests that it may be beneficial for campaigns to identity voters with low political knowledge and target them with their ads. Effectiveness of advertising can also depend on whether or not the candidate is an incumbent or a challenger. While incumbent campaign advertising still has a statistically significant impact on voter choice, ads for challengers have been found to be more productive (Stratmann 2009). Incumbents are generally more well known to voters, so they have already formed judgements about them. Challengers benefit more from advertising because they usually have lower name recognition than incumbents. Political advertisements are not immune to the decaying effects of time. This is particularly true with television advertisements. During the week they are released, TV ads exert a strong effect on voter choice. The week after release they still exert a small effect, but there is no statistically significant effect thereafter (Gerber et. al, 2011). If campaigns wanted to mitigate this decay they might benefit from creating more memorable or provocative advertisements.</p>
<p> A considerable amount of literature exists on the influence of television ads on voter choice. Most sources tend to agree that they have a significant impact on the preferences of the American voter (Franz & Ridout, 2010; Gerber et. al, 2011; Brader 2005). Research has also shown that racial cues in TV ads can activate racial attitudes and influence voter choice (Valentino, Hutchings, and White, 2002) An essay by Goldstein and Ridout (2004) contends that research on the effectiveness of TV ads have not been structured in a way to accurately measure it. They critique several methods of measuring the effects of advertisements. This includes experiments that expose respondents to ads in a controlled environment. Television advertisements usually appear in the middle of other programming so researchers should not show spots in isolation. These experiments also do not typically mirror the number or intensity that voters are exposed to TV spots. During the election season, people often experience the same ad multiple times throughout the day. Lab experiments hardly ever expose respondents to the same spot more than once or twice. This suggests that researchers have a long way to go before they can accurately measure the pervasiveness of TV ads. </p>
<p> While television spots continue to dominate a large portion of campaign communication, spending on social media ads has increased dramatically in recent years (Stewart 2017). Twitter is a popular social media platform for consuming political information (Cillizza 2013). Research has shown that the use of Twitter by candidates during the 2010 elections played a positive role in the amount of votes they received (Kruikemeier 2014). The frequency of tweets made by candidates did not have an effect on voter choice but the content of them did. Candidates that used interactive features of twitter, such as mentions, received more votes than candidates who did not. This supports the conclusion that two-way communication is an effective way of influencing voters in new media. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Byproducts of Campaign Advertising </h3>
<p> Aside from voter choice, there are two byproducts of campaign advertising on our political system: voter sophistication and voter turnout. Freedman, Franz, and Goldstein (2004) examine the argument that political advertisements depreciate levels of political knowledge among voters. To do this, they gathered data from both presidential and congressional ads from the 2000 election. Knowledge of which candidates are running or “recall accuracy” increases with exposure to congressional campaign ads. Presidential ads have no effect on recall accuracy because presidential elections are so widely covered in the news. This makes it hard not to know the names of the candidates. Conversely, presidential ads were shown to positively contribute to respondents knowledge of political issues but congressional ads had no significant effects. These findings show that political ads do increase certain aspects of voter sophistication. </p>
<p> Research on political advertising and voter turnout has produced interesting results. Overall, scholars agree that political ads only have a moderate effect on voter turnout at best. Emotionally evocative ads, such as ones that use fear cues, were shown to have a slight positive influence on the likelihood of voting (Brader 2005). Presidential TV ads during the 2000 election were also shown to have a minimal effect on voter turnout (Krasno & Green, 2008). Franz et. al (2008) argue that there is little evidence that advertising has a depreciative effect on turnout, however other researchers have found different results. An analysis of turnout for the 2004 presidential elections showed negative campaign ads can affect voter turnout but only under one specific condition: when voters have already selected which candidate to support. Under this circumstance, negative ads do not persuade voters to support a different candidate it merely discourages them from going to the polls (Krupnikov 2011). Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of research on political advertising and turnout. Vavreck (2007) contends that researchers rely too much on self reporting from respondents about whether or not they recalled an advertisement when going to the polls. When self reporting alone is measured, advertising is shown to increase turnout. When you measure actual exposure to advertising instead, advertising is shown to have no effect on turnout. Young people reported voting in the election of 2002 at a rate of 35%. After looking at validated voter information, it is found that the actual turnout rate among young people in the survey is 12%. With the lack of evidence that advertising influences voter turnout, it is safe to conclude that there is little relationship between exposure to ads and participation in elections. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Examining Negative Advertisements </h3>
<p> Negative political advertisements is a topic of strong contention among scholars of public opinion. The percentage of ads which cast a pessimistic light on a candidate has increased greatly over the years. In the 2006 elections, 65% of all congressional advertisements were negative spots. Presidential campaigns are even more negative, 73% of all 2008 general election airings were attack ads (Fowler & Motta, 2016). Negative messages which contained fear cues were found to significantly influence voter choice (Brader 2005). Repeated exposure to negative ads were found to damage the targeted candidate credibility which benefits the vote share of the sponsoring candidate. However candidates should avoid the overuse of attack ads because they have a “boomerang effect”: they have the intended effect for a while but eventually they harm opinions of the sponsor as well (King & McConnell, 2003). Pinkelton, Um, and Austin (2002) conducted a study on college students comparing the influence of positive and negative campaign ads on voter information. Participants found negative ads to be less useful for political decision making and caused them to have a negative opinion on political campaigns. Positive ads were shown to be more persuasive in vote choice and ultimately left respondents with a better outlook on political campaigns. Some researchers claim that negative ads have virtually no effect and can even be counterproductive for their sponsors. Lau, Sigelman, and Rovner (2007) contend that there is no evidence in the literature which shows that negative campaigning achieves the desired results that the attackers desire. They also found that while attack ads do undermine evaluations of the candidate they target, they usually bring evaluations of the attacker down even more. Because of this, the overall effect of negative ads on vote choice is insignificant. Attack ads do have other systemic consequences, such as lower trust in government and a darker public mood. </p>
<h3 align="left"> Conclusion </h3>
<p> Political communication in the form of campaign advertising has been proven to be a salient topic in our political process. There is a significant body of literature which shows that advertising does have a strong influence on vote choice. Researchers found these results from analyzing both the presidential and congressional elections of 2004 (Franz & Ridout, 2007) and 2008 (Franz & Ridout, 2010). There are a few caveats which can limit the effectiveness of advertising, such as voter sophistication (Granato & Wong, 2004) and whether the sponsor is an incumbent or a challenger (Stratmann 2009). The influence of advertising also decays quickly over time (Gerber et. al, 2011). Social media use by candidate can also be an effective way of advertising, especially if they use interactive features to communicate with voters (Kruikemeier 2014). Like voter choice, campaign advertising also influences aspects of voter sophistication. This includes recall accuracy, or how well a voter can remember candidates names, and knowledge of policy issues (Freedman, Franz, and Goldstein, 2004). Despite a contentious debate about whether advertising increases or decreases voter turnout, there is little evidence of a significant link between exposure to ads and participation in elections (Franz et. al, 2008; Krupnikov 2011; Vavreck 2007). Overall, political advertising does significantly influence voter choice and voter sophistication, but not voter turnout. </p>
<p> Negative advertising has been found to be a high-risk, high-reward tool for political communication. Attack ads exude a “boomerang effect” on vote choice. They have the intended effect of lowering the vote share of their target, but overuse of attack ads can damage the reputation of the sponsor just as much or more (King & McConnell, 2003; Lau, Sigelman, and Rovner, 2007). A comparison between negative and positive advertising showed that negative advertising less useful for making political decisions than positive advertising (Pinkelton, Um, and Austin, 2002). Negative advertising was also shown to lower voters trust in the government and darken their perception of the political process (Lau, Sigelman, and Rovner, 2007). Evidence for the dangers of negative advertising and their systemic consequences which hurt our political discourse, suggests that campaigns should avoid the overuse of them. Positive advertisements which outline the good qualities of a candidate do not come with the same risk or negative side effects that attacks do. All of these factors lead to the conclusion that campaigns should focus on positive advertising much more than they currently do and negative advertising should be kept to a minimum. </p>
