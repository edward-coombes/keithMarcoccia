<h2 align="center">Assessing Justifications for the Iraq War </h2>
<p>Following the precedent of regime change in American foreign policy, the Bush Administration overthrew Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. This was achieved through a very controversial and polarizing invasion of Iraq. President Bush assured the American people that it was to be a short and successful campaign. Instead, the United States endured a grueling five-year war, that cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars. President Bush’s decision to declare war on Iraq in 2003 was an extremely misguided one, as the justifications for it were not backed up by sufficient evidence, and serious consequences arose as a result of the war. It was misguided because Saddam Hussein was not aiding al-Qaeda, as Vice President Dick Cheney contended, the opposite was true he was trying to undermine them. The Iraqi government did not have active chemical weapons that they were using on their citizens, the ones found were decades old and mostly dormant. A severe consequence of the invasion was the spread of Islamic terrorism spread throughout the world. The Iraq war was unnecessary, and will forever be remembered as a world tragedy. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, March 16th, 2003, President George W. Bush addressed the nation live on tv; "My fellow citizens. At this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.” It soon became apparent that these rationales for war were flimsy at best. They were based off of bad information and propped up by certain members of our political discourse, who were far too eager for boots on the ground in Iraq. One of these Pro-war advocates was Vice President Dick Cheney, who stated in an interview with National Public Radio in January of 2004, that there was “overwhelming evidence” of a partnership between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. He based this assertion off of the Iraqi Government’s purported harboring of Abdul Rahman Yasin, who carried out the 1993 World Trade Center attacks. Cheney neglected to mention however, that the Iraqi government offered to turn Yasin over to the US on two occasions. First to the Clinton administration in 1994, and again in 2001 when Yasin was put on the most wanted list. Deputy Prime Minister to Iraq, Aziz Tariq, described the latter in an interview on CBS’ program 60 Minutes. The Iraqi government offered to deliver Yasin through a third party government, which was later revealed to be Egypt, and the US agreed. Tariq told 60 Minutes “We said, okay. We will take the man to the capital of that country, and deliver him to the American authorities. But, they should sign a paper, that they have received Yasin from the Iraqi authorities, in the presence of the third party. They refused to sign a paper. And therefore, the delivery did not take place” If Hussein was truly an ally of al-Qaeda, it seems unlikely that he would offer to turn over a prime al-Qaeda operative to the US. </p>
<p> Many organizations doubted Iraq’s ties to al-Qaeda before the war began. In January of 2003, the CIA released a report to congress titled Iraqi Support for Terrorism. It concludes that "...the relationship between Iraq and al-Qaeda appears to more closely resemble that of two independent actors trying to exploit each other—their mutual suspicion suborned by al-Qaeda's interest in Iraqi assistance, and Baghdad's interest in al-Qaeda's anti-U.S. attacks. … The Intelligence Community has no credible information that Baghdad had foreknowledge of the 11 September attacks or any other al-Qaida strike." This is backed up by reports from the DIA in 2002, 2003 Israeli intelligence, and the 9/11 commission in 2004. They all reported of little to no evidence of an alliance between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, which makes this justification for the Iraq War baseless. </p>
<p> The deposition of Saddam Hussein caused a vacuum of power within many regions of Iraq. As a result, terrorism has increased exponentially in Iraq since the invasion. In 2002, one year before the start of the Iraq War, there were 6 recorded incidents of terrorism, which resulted in 10 fatalities. Fatalities jumped to 317 in 2003, just a few months after the start of the invasion, and continued to increase significantly until 2007. Terrorist activity in Iraq has increased again during the past few years and Iraq is currently ranked highest in the Global Terrorism Database.. The Bush Administration believed that the overthrow of Hussein would prevent Iraq from becoming a safe haven for terrorists, but in doing so they caused the exact opposite to transpire. Many jihadist leaders cite the presence of US troops in Iraq as a powerful recruiting tool. Al-Qaeda strategist Abu Mus'ab al-Suri, claims that the Iraq War almost single-handedly rescued the jihadi movement. President Bush himself described Iraq as a “central front in the war on terrorism.” It was not true when he uttered those words in 2003, but is a harsh reality in the world today. </p>
<p> In a speech given in Ohio on October 7th, 2002, President Bush made the following statement, "The Iraqi regime...possesses and produces chemical and biological weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons. We know that the regime has produced thousands of tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, sarin nerve gas, VX nerve gas.” Several other members of the Bush Administration made similar claims on several occasions both before and during the Iraq War. The intelligence report made by the CIA which prompted these statements, and led the senate to formally declare war on Iraq, was declassified and released to the public in 2015. It’s findings were flimsy at best and hardly constituted enough evidence to state with certainty that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destruction. The CIA confidently reported that Iraq has “probably” renovated a manufacturing plant to produce biological weapons, but also admitted that they were unable to determine if research on biological agents had resumed. What they were sure of however was that Hussein did not have sufficient material to manufacture nuclear weapons, “the information we have on Iraqi nuclear personnel does not appear consistent with a coherent effort to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program.” This means that the Bush Administration had access to classified intelligence which stated that there wasn’t enough evidence to determine if Iraq was producing biological weapons, and that it was unlikely that they had the capacity to produce nuclear weapons, and then proceeded to tell the world the exact opposite. </p>
<p> During the course of the war, American troops did encounter chemical weapons on several occasions. However they were not the same chemical weapons the US was looking for, they were old remnants of Iraq’s arms program from the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980’s. American service members who encountered them were interviewed in a piece by the New York Times. According to them, “All had been manufactured before 1991, participants said. Filthy, rusty or corroded, a large fraction of them could not be readily identified as chemical weapons at all. Some were empty, though many of them still contained potent mustard agent or residual sarin. Most could not have been used as designed, and when they ruptured dispersed the chemical agents over a limited area” The Bush Administration kept these findings a secret during the war because it conflicted with their claims of new, active wmd’s being produced by the Hussein regime. This shows that yet another justification for the Iraq war was based on faulty intelligence.</p>
<p> There is no question that Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator who repeatedly violated the basic human rights of his citizens. Many atrocities were committed by his regime, from the restriction of free speech and free assembly of his citizens, to the mass murder of the Kurdish people living in Northern Iraq. This charge against him from the US was valid, and the only justification for the Iraq War that can stand the test of scrutiny. However it is unlikely that this was the main concern of the Bush Administration, because it has supported several regimes who violate the rights of its citizens. An example of this is the alliance with Saudi Arabia. The US has had ties with Saudi Arabia for decades, as US businesses have a large stake in the Saudi oil trade. The Saudi Arabian government has been accused of human rights abuses on numerous occasions over the years. They sentence their citizens to severe corporal punishment, which includes flogging and the amputation of body parts, for minor offenses. Saudi Arabia also sponsors public executions, which is typically carried out by beheadings, but also includes stoning, firing squads, and crucifixion. The Bush Administration turned a blind eye to human rights violations in Saudi Arabia because it suited their interests, and chose to be morally outraged by human rights violations in Iraq because it suited their interests. In this sense, the Iraq War was a hypocritical endeavor. </p>
<p> The rationales presented to the American people for the invasion of Iraq were not based in reality. The wmd’s found in Iraq that the Bush Administration declared with certainty were being actively produced by Hussein’s regime, were dormant devices, leftover from a conflict that took place decades earlier. Although he had access to documents from the CIA which cast doubt on an alliance between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, President Bush lept to the opposite conclusion and claimed that the Iraqi government assisted al-Qaeda in terrorist attacks. While the goal of the Bush Administration may have been to diminish terrorist activity, islamic terrorism is a scourge on Iraq like it has never been before thanks to the US occupation. The Iraq War is referred to by many as the most disastrous foreign policy decision of the modern era, and the Presidency of George W. Bush will be marred by it for decades to come. </p>
